This project uses React (Next.js) with Tailwind CSS for building responsive, modern e-commerce components like sliders, cards, and testimonials. Swiper.js is used for touch-enabled carousels, and Lucide React provides lightweight icons.

Responsive Strategy:

Desktop (lg:) layouts remain as designed.

Tablet (md:) and mobile (sm:) layouts use flexible widths, stacked or wrapped content, and scaled text/images for readability.

Buttons, cards, and images are resized and spaced appropriately to maintain usability on smaller screens.

Extra Features:

Hover animations on cards (scale and shadow) for interactivity.

Radial gradient overlays for depth without breaking responsiveness.

Custom Swiper navigation buttons that adjust size and position on mobile.

Next/Image used for optimized and responsive image loading.

The design prioritizes flexibility, readability, and smooth user experience across all device sizes.
